Subject: [PATCH v26 01/12] Linux Random Number Generator
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In an effort to provide a flexible implementation for a random number
generator that also delivers entropy during early boot time, allows
replacement of the deterministic random number generation mechanism,
implement the various components in separate code for easier
maintenance, and provide compliance to SP800-90[A|B|C], introduce
the Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) framework.

The general design is as follows. Additional implementation details
are given in [1]. The LRNG consists of the following components:

1. The LRNG may contain a True Random Number Generator (TRNG). The
TRNG is a deterministic random number generator that is operated as
a true random number generator. Using SP800-90A terminology, the
TRNG is a DRBG with prediction resistance. The TRNG has a behavior
similar to SP800-90A's concept of prediction resistance by only
generating output when it is re-seeded with an equal amount of
entropy. Every time a caller requests random numbers, the TRNG
must be re-seeded with at least that amount of entropy from its noise
sources. During boot time, the TRNG is not yet operated with
prediction resistance. As the external interfaces to the TRNG to
obtain random numbers start to be accessible after boot time
completes, random numbers generated via these interfaces always
access the TRNG that is operated with prediction resistance.

2. The LRNG implements a secondary DRNG. The secondary DRNG always
generates the requested amount of output. When using the SP800-90A
terminology it operates without prediction resistance. The secondary
DRNG maintains a counter of how many bytes were generated since last
re-seed and a timer of the elapsed time since last re-seed. If either
the counter or the timer reaches a threshold, the secondary DRNG is
seeded from the TRNG.

In case the Linux kernel detects a NUMA system, one secondary DRNG
instance per NUMA node is maintained.

3. The TRNG is seeded by concatenating the data from the
following sources:

(a) the output of the entropy pool,

(b) the Jitter RNG if available and enabled, and

(c) the CPU-based noise source such as Intel RDRAND if available and
enabled.

The entropy estimate of the data of all noise sources are added to
form the entropy estimate of the data used to seed the TRNG with.
The LRNG ensures, however, that the TRNG after seeding is at
maximum the security strength of the TRNG.

The LRNG is designed such that none of these noise sources can dominate
the other noise sources to provide seed data to the TRNG during
boot time due to the following:

(a) During boot time, the amount of received interrupts are the trigger
points to (re)seed the TRNG.

(b) At runtime, the caller requesting random numbers from the primary
TRNG drives the reseeding where always as much entropy as available is
used to reseed the TRNG.

4. The entropy pool accumulates entropy obtained from certain events,
which will henceforth be collectively called "slow noise sources".
The entropy pool collects noise data from slow noise sources. Any data
received by the LRNG from the slow noise sources is inserted into the
entropy pool using an LFSR with a primitive and irreducible polynomial.
The following sources of entropy are used:

 (a) When an interrupt occurs, the high-resolution time stamp is mixed
into the LFSR. This time stamp is credited with heuristically implied
entropy.

 (b) HID event data like the key stroke or the mouse coordinates are
mixed into the LFSR. This data is not credited with entropy by the LRNG.

 (c) Device drivers may provide data that is mixed into the LFSR. This
data is not credited with entropy by the LRNG.

 (d) After the entropy pool is ``read'' by the TRNG, the data
used to seed the TRNG is mixed back into the entropy pool to
stir the pool. This data is not credited with entropy by the LRNG.

Any data provided from user space by either writing to /dev/random,
/dev/urandom or the IOCTL of RNDADDENTROPY on both device files
are always injected into the entropy pool.

In addition, when a hardware random number generator covered by the
Linux kernel HW generator framework wants to deliver random numbers,
it is injected into the entropy pool as well. HW generator noise source
is handled separately from the other noise source due to the fact that
the HW generator framework may decide by itself when to deliver data
whereas the other noise sources always requested for data driven by the
LRNG operation. Similarly any user space provided data is inserted into
the entropy pool.

When the TRNG requires data from the entropy pool, the entire
entropy pool is processed with an SP800-90A section 10.3.1 compliant
hash_df function to generate random numbers.

To speed up the interrupt handling code of the LRNG, the time stamp
collected for an interrupt event is truncated to the 8 least
significant bits. 64 truncated time stamps are concatenated and then
jointly inserted into the LFSR. During boot time, until the fully seeded
stage is reached, each time stamp with its 32 least significant bits is
inserted into the LFSR at the time of arrival.

The LRNG allows the TRNG and secondary DRNG mechanism to be changed
at runtime. Per default, a ChaCha20-based DRNG is used. The ChaCha20-DRNG
implemented for the LRNG is also provided as a stand-alone user space
deterministic random number generator. The LRNG also offers an
SP800-90A DRBG based on the Linux kernel crypto API DRBG implementation.

The DRNG allows two methods of obtaining random data:

* For users requiring random numbers from a seeded and frequently reseeded
secondary DRNG, such as the /dev/urandom, the getrandom system call with
GRND_RANDOM or with a zero flags field, /dev/random, or the in-kernel
get_random_bytes function, the secondary DRNG is accessed directly by
invoking its generate function. This generate function complies with the
generate function discussed in SP800-90A.

* Users requiring random data that contains information theoretical
entropy, such as for seeding other DRNGs also use the TRNG's
generate function via the /dev/random device file and the getrandom
system call when invoked with GRND_TRUERANDOM. The difference to the
/dev/urandom handling is that:

 1. each TRNG generate request is limited to the amount of entropy
the of the DRNG was seeded with, and

 2. each TRNG generate request is preceded by a reseeding of the
DRNG to implement a TRNG / a DRNG with prediction resistance.

The processing of entropic data from the noise source before injecting
them into the TRNG is performed with the following mathematical
operations:

1. LFSR: The 8 least significant bits of the time stamp data received
from the interrupts are processed with an LFSR. That LFSR is implemented
identically to the LSFR used in the existing /dev/random implementation
except that it is capable of processing an entire word and that a
different polynomial is used. The reason for the different polynomial
is performance in a performance sensitive code section, the interrupt
handler. The chosen polynomials have 4 taps. Also, this LFSR-approach
is used in the OpenBSD /dev/random equivalent.

2. Concatenation: The temporary seed buffer used to seed the TRNG is
a concatenation of parts of the entropy pool data, and the CPU noise
source output.

The TRNG always tries to seed itself with 256 bits of entropy,
except during boot. In any case, if the noise sources cannot deliver
that amount, the available entropy is used and the TRNG keeps
track on how much entropy it was seeded with. The entropy implied by
the LRNG available in the entropy pool may be too conservative.
To ensure that during boot time all available entropy from the entropy
pool is transferred to the TRNG, the hash_df function always
generates 256 data bits during boot to seed the TRNG. Yet, the
TRNG entropy estimate is only increased by the amount of entropy the
LRNG assumes to be present in that data. During boot, the TRNG
is seeded as follows:

1. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if the entropy pool has collected at least 32 bits of
entropy from the interrupt noise source. The goal of this step is to
ensure that the primary and secondary DRNG receive some initial entropy
as early as possible. In addition it receives the entropy available from
the fast noise sources.

2. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if all noise sources collectively can provide at least
128 bits of entropy.

3. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if all noise sources collectivel can provide at least 256
bits.

At the time of the reseeding steps, the DRNG requests as much entropy as
is available in order to skip certain steps and reach the seeding level
of 256 bits. This may imply that one or more of the aforementioned steps
are skipped.

In all listed steps, the secondary DRNG is (re)seeded with a number of
random bytes from the TRNG that is equal to the amount of
entropy the TRNG was seeded with. This means that when the
TRNG is seeded with 128 or 256 bits of entropy, the secondary
DRNG is seeded with that amount of entropy as well. There is only one
exception to that rule: during initialization before the seed level of
128 bits is reached, a random number with 128 bit is generated by the
TRNG to seed the secondary DRNG.

Before the TRNG is seeded with 256 bits of entropy in step 3,
requests of random data from /dev/random are not processed.

At runtime, the TRNG delivers only random bytes equal to the
entropy amount it was seeded with. E.g. if the TRNG was seeded
with 128 bits of entropy, it will return only 128 bits of random data.
Subsequent requests for random data are only fulfilled after a
reseeding operation of the TRNG.

The TRNG will always require that all entropy sources collectively
can deliver at least as many entropy bits as configured with
/proc/sys/kernel/random/read_wakeup_threshold, i.e. per default 129 bits
(128 bits of entropy for seeding plus one bit of entropy that is lost
with the post processing as defined in SP800-90B).

The secondary DRNG operates as deterministic random number generator with
the following properties:

* The maximum number of random bytes that can be generated with one
DRNG generate operation is limited to 4096 bytes. When longer random
numbers are requested, multiple DRNG generate operations are performed.
The ChaCha20 DRNG as well as the SP800-90A DRBGs implement an update of
their state after completing a generate request for backtracking
resistance.

* The secondary DRNG is reseeded with whatever entropy is available –
in the worst case where no additional entropy can be provided by the
noise sources, the DRNG is not re-seeded and continues its operation
to try to reseed again after again the expiry of one of these thresholds:

 - If the last reseeding of the secondary DRNG is more than 600 seconds
   ago, or

 - 2^20 DRNG generate operations are performed, whatever comes first, or

 - the secondary DRNG is forced to reseed before the next generation of
   random numbers if data has been injected into the LRNG by writing data
   into /dev/random or /dev/urandom.

The chosen values prevent high-volume requests from user space to cause
frequent reseeding operations which drag down the performance of the
DRNG.

When the secondary DRNG requests a reseeding from the TRNG and
the TRNG pulls from the entropy pool, an emergency entropy level
of 512 bits of entropy is left in the entropy pool. This emergency
entropy is provided to serve getrandom(GRND_TRUERANDOM) even
when called by a process possessing CAP_SYS_ADMIN while /dev/urandom
is stressed.

To ensure that unprivileged users cannot deplete the entropy pool
completely, getrandom(GRND_TRUERANDOM) will leave an emergency level
of 1024 bits of entropy in the entropy pool when it is called by
an unprivileged application. This allows the secondary DRNGs to be
seeded twice with full entropy.

With the automatic reseeding after 600 seconds, the LRNG is triggered
to reseed itself before the first request after a suspend that put the
hardware to sleep for longer than 600 seconds.

The TRNG may not be compiled. In this case, the aforementioned
statements covering the TRNG are not applicable. The secondary DRNG is
seeded directly from the entropy pool just like the TRNG would have been
seeded.

The LRNG has the following properties:

* internal noise source: interrupts timing with fast boot time seeding

* high performance of interrupt handling code: The LRNG impact on the
interrupt handling has been reduced to a minimum. On one example
system, the LRNG interrupt handling code executes within an average
of 65 cycles whereas the existing /dev/random on the same device
takes about 97 cycles when measuring the execution time of
add_interrupt_randomness().

* lockless LFSR to collect raw entropy

* use of standalone ChaCha20 based RNG with the option to use a
  different DRNG selectable at compile time

* "atomic" seeding of secondary DRBG to ensure full entropy transport

* instantiate one DRNG per NUMA node

* support for runtime switchable output DRNGs

* support for TRNG deactivation: The LRNG supports the compile-time
deactivation of the TRNG (i.e. deactivating
getrandom(GRND_TRUERANDOM)).

* use of only well-defined entropy-preserving operations to collect,
compress and forward entropy: concatenation, LFSR, SP800-90A hash_df
function

* compile-time selectable entropy pool size: the choice also
uses the applicable LFSR polynomial to maintain the entropy pool
size

Further details including the rationale for the design choices and
properties of the LRNG together with testing is provided at [1].
In addition, the documentation explains the conducted regression
tests to verify that the LRNG is API and ABI compatible with the
existing /dev/random implementation.
