Subject: [PATCH v24 08/12] crypto: provide access to a static Jitter RNG state
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To support the LRNG operation which uses the Jitter RNG separately
from the kernel crypto API, at a time where potentially the regular
memory management is not yet initialized, the Jitter RNG needs to
provide a state whose memory is defined at compile time. As only once
instance will ever be needed by the LRNG, define once static memory
block which is solely to be used by the LRNG.
